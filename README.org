* comps: Implementing Racket's for comprehensions in Python

** Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a Python version of Racket's
*for* comprehensions. The *for_fold* function simulates the behavior
of Racket's *for/fold*, including handling multiple accumulators,
applying filters, and producing custom results.

This project uses Python 3.11+ and cytoolz for its functional
programming utilities.

** Features
- Multiple accumulators over multiple iterables.
- Optional filtering using a *when* clause.
- Flexible result expressions via a *result* clause.
- Typed, using Python's typing system for clarity.

** Example Usage

Coming soon!
